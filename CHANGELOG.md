**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-codegen/compare/0.11.0...0.12.0

# dbt-codegen v0.11.0

## ðŸš¨ Breaking change

`include_data_types` parameter added to `generate_model_yaml` and behavior changed for `generate_source`. Both default to `true`
and are lowercase to align with the dbt style guide. Scale & precision are **not** included. Previous logic for `generate_source` defaulted to `false` and the resulting data types were uppercase and included scale & precision ([#122](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-codegen/pull/122)).

[Dispatch](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/dispatch) can be used to utilize the column data type formatting of previous versions. Namely, by adding this macro to your project:

```sql
{% macro default__data_type_format_source(column) %}
    {{ return(column.data_type | upper) }}
{% endmacro %}
```

And then adding this within `dbt_project.yml`:

```yaml
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: codegen
    search_order: ["my_project", "codegen"]
```

# dbt-codegen v0.9.0

# dbt-codegen v0.8.1

# dbt-codegen v0.8.0

# Unreleased

## Breaking changes

## New features

## Quality of life

- Now uses `print` instead of `log` to output the generated text into the console. This enables you to invoke dbt with the `--quiet` flag and directly pipe the codegen output into a new file, ending up with valid yaml

## Under the hood

## Contributors:

- [@JorgenG](https://github.com/JorgenG) (#86)

# dbt-codegen v0.7.0

## ðŸš¨ Breaking change

- Add support for including description placeholders for the source and table, which changes the behavior of `generate_source` when `include_descriptions` is set to `True`. Previous logic only created description placeholders for the columns ([#64](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-codegen/issues/64), [#66](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-codegen/pull/66))

## New features

- Add optional `table_names` arg to `generate_source` ([#50](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-codegen/issues/50), [#51](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-codegen/pull/51))
- Add support for importing descriptions from columns with the same names in upstream models. It is available by setting the parameter `upstream_descriptions` to `True` in `generate_model_yaml` ([#61](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-codegen/pull/61))
- Added `case_sensitive_cols` argument to `generate_base_model` macro ([#63](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-codegen/pull/63))
- Add optional `name` arg to `generate_source` ([#64](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-codegen/issues/64), [#66](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-codegen/pull/66))

## Fixes

- `generate_model_yaml` now correctly handles nested `STRUCT` fields in BigQuery ([#27](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-codegen/issues/27), [#54](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-codegen/pull/54))

# dbt-codegen v0.6.0

This release creates breaking changes to the `generate_source.sql` macro.

## Features

- add optional `table_pattern` argument to `generate_source.sql` macro. Default value is '%' to pull all tables in the raw data schema to preserve existing behavior if the `table_pattern` argument is not specified by the user.

# dbt-codegen v0.5.0

This release supports any version (minor and patch) of v1, which means far less need for compatibility releases in the future.

## Under the hood

- Change `require-dbt-version` to `[">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"]`
- Bump dbt-utils dependency
- Replace `source-paths` and `data-paths` with `model-paths` and `seed-paths` respectively
- Rename `data` and `analysis` directories to `seeds` and `analyses` respectively
- Replace `dbt_modules` with `dbt_packages` in `clean-targets`

# dbt-codegen v0.4.1

ðŸš¨ This is a compatibility release in preparation for `dbt-core` v1.0.0 (ðŸŽ‰). Projects using this version with `dbt-core` v1.0.x can expect to see a deprecation warning. This will be resolved in the next minor release.

# dbt-codegen v0.4.0

## Breaking changes

- Requires `dbt>=0.20.0` and `dbt-utils>=0.7.0`
- Depends on `dbt-labs/dbt_utils` (instead of `fishtown-analytics/dbt_utils`)

## Features

- Add optional `leading_commas` arg to `generate_base_model` (#41 @jaypeedevlin)
- Add optional `include_descriptions` arg to `generate_source` (#40 @djbelknapdbs)

## Fixes

- In the `generate_source` macro, use `dbt_utils.get_relations_by_pattern` instead of `get_relations_by_prefix`, since the latter will be deprecated in the future (#42)

## Under the hood

- Use new adapter.dispatch syntax (#44)

# dbt-codegen v0.3.2

This is a quality of life release

## Other

- Fix rendering issues on hub.getdbt.com
- Fix integration tests due to python version compatibility

# dbt-codegen v0.3.1

This is a bugfix release

## Fixes

- Use latest version of dbt-utils (0.6.2) to ensure generate_source_yaml works for non-target schemata (#34)

# dbt-codegen v0.3.0

## ðŸš¨ Breaking change

This release requires dbt v0.18.0, and dbt-utils v0.6.1. If you're not ready to upgrade, consider using a previous release of this package.

## Quality of life

- Use dbt v0.18.0 (#31)
- Fix README rendering on hub (#32 @calvingiles)

# dbt-codegen v0.2.0

## ðŸš¨ Breaking change

The lower bound of `dbt-utils` is now `0.4.0`.

This won't affect most users, since you're likely already using version of dbt-utils higher than this to achieve 0.17.0 compatibility.

## Quality of life:

- Change dbt-utils dependencies to `[>=0.4.0, <0.6.0]` (#29)
- Fix tests (#29)

# dbt-codegen v0.1.0

## ðŸš¨ Breaking change!

This package now requires dbt v0.17.x!

## Features:

- Add `generate_model_yaml` (#18 @jtalmi)

## Under the hood:

- Update to v0.17.0, including `dbt_project.yml` version 2 syntax (#23)
- Add GitHub templates and installation instructions (#23)

## Acknowledgements

@marzaccaro made a PR for `generate_model_yaml`, and, although I had reviewed it, I let the PR go stale and somehow completely forgot about it when merging PR #18 â€” this is completely my bad! So equal credit to @marzaccaro and @jtalmi for their work :clap:

# dbt-codegen v0.0.4

This is a bugfix release to improve compatibility with Snowflake

# dbt-codegen v0.0.3

Bump utils version range

# dbt-codegen v0.0.2
